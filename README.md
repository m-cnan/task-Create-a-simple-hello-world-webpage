## Summary
This project is a simple HTML page that displays "Hello World" and includes basic interactive functionality. The page showcases essential web development practices and features a responsive design alongside a hover effect on the text.

## Setup
To set up and run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Download the Code**: Clone this repository or download the `index.html` file.
   
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   ```
   
2. **Navigate to the Directory**: Change into the project directory if it has been cloned.

   ```bash
   cd [project-directory]
   ```

3. **Open the HTML File**: Open the `index.html` file in a web browser of your choice. This can usually be done by double-clicking the file or right-clicking and selecting "Open with" followed by your browser.

## Usage
Once the HTML page is open in your web browser, you will see the text "Hello World" displayed in the center of the page. Here are a few interactive features:

- **Hover Effect**: When you hover over the text, it will change color to indicate interactivity.
- **Click Event**: Clicking on the "Hello World" text will trigger an alert displaying the message "Hello World clicked!".

## Code Explanation
This project consists of a single HTML file (`index.html`). Hereâ€™s a breakdown of its components:

- The `<head>` section includes metadata, a title, and internal CSS styles for basic layout and design.
- The `<style>` block provides styles to center the text and create a hover effect on the `h1` element.
- The `<body>` section contains the main content, which is an `h1` element with the text "Hello World".
- A `<script>` block is included at the end of the document to add interactivity. It listens for click events on the `h1` element and displays an alert when clicked.

The combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript demonstrates fundamental web development techniques and helps in understanding how components work together to create a functional web page.
